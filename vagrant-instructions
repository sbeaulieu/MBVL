Instructions for checking out / using vagrantfile (e.g., for IPython Notebooks and dependencies in the MBVL project)

[Note: these instructions are for Windows 10.]

Download Git for Windows, https://git-scm.com/download/win, and:
- run the installer as Administrator
- during installation, select "Checkout as is, commit Unix-style line endings"

Download and Install VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/) 

Download and install Vagrant 1.7.4 - the latest version will not work properly in Windows 10
https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.7.4/vagrant_1.7.4.msi

Reboot

Navigate in windows browser to target github folder, e.g.: https://github.com/joefutrelle/scipy-talk

Click on the green button "Clone or download" to view the URL, then click the rightmost box to copy the URL to clipboard

Open Git Bash, type "ls" to figure out what directory you are starting in, then change directory, e.g. "cd Documents"

Type "git clone " and right-click to paste the URL, return, and then a subfolder (e.g. scipy-talk) is created in Documents

[Next set of steps is to run the vagrantfile]

Change directory into that subfolder "cd scipy-talk" and type "vagrant up" (and then a virtual machine is built with ubuntu linux and a bunch of python libraries are installed)
(FYI, don't use the VirtualBox GUI for Vagrant VMs; those VMs are "headless" and have no GUI) 

Continuing in Git Bash (in the above case, in the scipy-talk directory),
Type "git pull" to get the latest updates.

Type "vagrant ssh". You will now be logged into the virtual machine and you will get a command prompt.

At the prompt, type "cd /vagrant", return

Then type "./ipn" [or see below for multiprocessing]
The iPython Notebook will start.

Now point your browser to "http://localhost:8888"

[If you'd like to run a Notebook with multiprocessing, see Joe's Introduction to multiprocessing in iPython notebook: https://gist.github.com/joefutrelle/39edb8b0eb63033ef9bb1069c348954a]
[Note to check the number of CPUs configured for the Virtual Machine, use text editor to open the vagrantfile. For example, look for a line in the vagrantfile such as vb.cpus="4".]
[For multiprocessing we will add the "&" symbol to start the Notebook in the background, type "./ipn &", return.]
[Then start the cluster for a number of CPUs not exceeding what is in vagrantfile, e.g., type "ipcluster start -n 4 &".]
[Then point your browser to "http://localhost:8888"]
