[Note: these instructions are for Windows 10.]

Download Git for Windows, https://git-scm.com/download/win, and:
- run the installer as Administrator
- during installation, select "Checkout as is, commit Unix-style line endings"

Download and Install VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/) 

Download and install Vagrant 1.7.4 - the latest version will not work properly in Windows 10
https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/1.7.4/vagrant_1.7.4.msi

Reboot

Navigate in windows browser to target github folder, e.g.: https://github.com/joefutrelle/scipy-talk

Click on the green button "Clone or download" to view the URL, then click the rightmost box to copy the URL to clipboard

Open Git Bash, type "ls" to figure out what directory you are starting in, then change directory, e.g. "cd Documents"

Type "git clone " and right-click to paste the URL, return, and then a subfolder (e.g. scipy-talk) is created in Documents

Go into that subfolder "cd scipy-talk" and type "vagrant up" (and then a virtual machine is built with ubuntu linux and a bunch of python libraries are installed)
(FYI, don't use the VirtualBox GUI for Vagrant VMs; those VMs are "headless" and have no GUI) 

From Git Bash, make sure you're in the scipy-talk directory.

Type "git pull" to get the latest updates.

Type "vagrant ssh". You will now be logged into the virtual machine and you will get a command prompt.

At the prompt, type "cd /vagrant", return

Then type "./ipn"
The iPython Notebook will start.

Now point your browser to "http://localhost:8888'
